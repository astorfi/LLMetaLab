## 🤝 **Expected Behavior**

We expect all community members to:

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat everyone with kindness and empathy. Disagreement is natural, but respect and understanding are essential.
2. **Be Collaborative**: Foster a culture of collaboration. Share knowledge, provide constructive feedback, and help each other grow.
3. **Use Welcoming Language**: Choose words that create an inclusive environment. Avoid offensive language and personal attacks.
4. **Be Mindful of the Impact**: Consider how your actions may impact others. We want to build a safe and supportive space for learning and contribution.
5. **Respect Differing Perspectives**: Discussions often benefit from diverse viewpoints. Disagreement is acceptable, but we ask that you communicate it respectfully.

## 🚫 **Unacceptable Behavior**

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable in our community:

1. **Harassment**: Including, but not limited to, offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or personal identity.
2. **Insults and Personal Attacks**: Avoid aggressive language, belittling, or any behavior that is intentionally demeaning.
3. **Disruptive Behavior**: Trolling, spamming, or intentionally derailing conversations is not tolerated.
4. **Sexualized Language or Imagery**: Any sexually explicit content is unacceptable, including in conversations, comments, or shared media.

## 🛠️ **Enforcement**

If someone engages in unacceptable behavior:

- **Moderators may take action**, including issuing a warning, removing offending comments, or, in severe cases, banning the contributor from the project.
- **Reports of misconduct** will be handled with care and confidentiality. We value the well-being and comfort of our community members.
