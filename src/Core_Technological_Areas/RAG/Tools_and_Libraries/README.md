# Tools and Libraries: Overview and Tutorials üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to the **Tools and Libraries** section of the repository! This directory is all about providing the essential knowledge and step-by-step guides you need to work with key tools used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and beyond. From understanding the fundamentals of vector databases to building and optimizing them for real-world applications, you'll find it all here.

## What's Inside?
This directory contains detailed tutorials and guides for working with popular tools and vector libraries that are crucial in building RAG and AI-based applications. Below, you'll find a quick overview of each document included here.

### 1. **faiss_basics.md** üî¢
A comprehensive guide to **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search). This guide takes you from the basics of vector indexing and similarity search to advanced indexing techniques. It also dives into the underlying mathematics and provides practical code examples for a hands-on understanding of how FAISS works.

### 2. **pinecone_setup.md** üåê
A user-friendly tutorial on getting started with **Pinecone**, a managed vector database. This document guides you through setting up Pinecone, creating and managing vector indexes, and optimizing for performance. It uses clear, approachable language and code snippets to make the process straightforward.

### 3. **weaviate_tutorial.md** üõèÔ∏è
An introductory guide to **Weaviate**, an open-source vector search engine that supports semantic search using machine learning models. This tutorial covers the installation, setup, schema definition, data insertion, and querying in Weaviate, with practical examples to get you up and running smoothly.

## How to Use This Directory
Each file in this directory is structured to provide:
1. **Conceptual Understanding**: The basic ideas behind the tool or library.
2. **Step-by-Step Setup**: How to install and configure the tool on your local or cloud environment.
3. **Practical Code Examples**: Code snippets you can use to learn or kick-start your projects.
4. **Advanced Techniques**: Deep dives for users who want to go beyond the basics and optimize their use cases.

## When to Use These Tools?
- **FAISS**: When you need a high-performance library for similarity search on large collections of vectors, such as in recommendation systems or clustering tasks.
- **Pinecone**: Ideal when you want a managed, scalable solution for vector indexing without dealing with the backend infrastructure.
- **Weaviate**: Perfect for semantic searches and when you need a flexible, schema-driven approach to vector data combined with powerful built-in integrations for generating embeddings.
