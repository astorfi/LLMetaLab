# Project: FAQ Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ðŸ¤–

## Overview

This project is aimed at building a sophisticated FAQ chatbot utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The chatbot will combine state-of-the-art document retrieval and natural language generation to create accurate, context-aware responses for frequently asked questions. This project is designed to simulate the challenges often encountered in the industry, such as scalability, handling ambiguous or complex queries, ensuring factual accuracy, and maintaining low latency under heavy loads. The end goal is to build a chatbot capable of seamless and efficient interactions with end users in a domain-specific setting.

## Project Scope and Challenges

1. **Scalable Retrieval System**: The system should be capable of scaling horizontally to handle large amounts of data and concurrent user interactions.
2. **Complex Query Handling**: The chatbot should be able to interpret vague, multi-faceted, and domain-specific questions.
3. **High Retrieval and Generation Quality**: Retrieved documents should be relevant and responses should be human-like, accurate, and grounded in reliable context.
4. **Factual Accuracy**: The system must provide factually accurate answers, minimizing any hallucination from the generative model.
5. **Low Latency Requirements**: Minimize response time while still providing high-quality responses for interactive use.

## Key Components

### 1. Document Collection and Indexing
- **Knowledge Base Construction**: Collect and curate a large, diverse knowledge base. This could include FAQs, documentation, user manuals, and domain-specific content.
- **Indexing**: Use vector databases like **FAISS**, **Pinecone**, or **Weaviate** for document indexing.
- **Metadata Tagging**: Enhance the searchability by adding metadata, such as categories, timestamps, and document relevance scores.

*Example code snippet for indexing documents with FAISS:*
```python
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Creating a FAISS index
dimension = 768  # Assuming embeddings of size 768
document_vectors = np.random.random((10000, dimension)).astype('float32')
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
index.add(document_vectors)  # Adding document vectors to the index
```

### 2. Retrieval Module
- **Hybrid Retrieval Approach**: Combine dense retrieval (e.g., BERT embeddings) with traditional sparse methods (e.g., BM25) to ensure high-quality results for different types of queries.
- **Re-Ranking**: Implement a re-ranking mechanism to prioritize retrieved documents based on contextual relevance.
- **Query Understanding**: Use NLP techniques to understand and reformulate user queries when necessary to enhance retrieval quality.

*Example for combining BM25 and dense retrieval:*
```python
from rank_bm25 import BM25Okapi
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util

# Sparse retrieval using BM25
tokenized_corpus = [doc.split(' ') for doc in documents]
bm25 = BM25Okapi(tokenized_corpus)

# Dense retrieval using BERT
model = SentenceTransformer('multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1')
query_embedding = model.encode("What is the refund policy?")
bm25_results = bm25.get_top_n("refund policy", documents, n=10)

# Combine BM25 with dense retrieval
bm25_embeddings = model.encode(bm25_results)
scores = util.dot_score(query_embedding, bm25_embeddings)
```

### 3. Generative Response Module
- **Model Selection**: Choose a generative model like **GPT-3**, **T5**, or **Flan-T5**, which can be fine-tuned on your domain-specific content.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Design prompts that direct the generative model to explicitly use retrieved content to minimize hallucinations.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Train the model further on domain-specific data for improved contextual relevance and accuracy.

*Example for fine-tuning a transformer model:*
```python
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Tokenizer

# Load a pre-trained T5 model
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('t5-base')
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('t5-base')

# Fine-tuning (assuming dataset has input-target pairs)
input_text = "question: What is the refund policy? context: Refunds can be processed within 30 days."
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors='pt')
labels = tokenizer.encode("Refunds are available within 30 days.", return_tensors='pt')

outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, labels=labels)
loss = outputs.loss
```

### 4. System Architecture
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Use asynchronous message queues (e.g., **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka**) for handling retrieval and generation independently, improving throughput.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Deploy the system using **Docker** and use **Kubernetes** for managing scalability and load balancing.
- **API Gateway**: Implement an API gateway for managing incoming user queries, directing them to the appropriate retrieval and generation services.

### 5. Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently asked questions using **Redis** or **Memcached** to reduce retrieval time for repeated queries.
- **Latency Reduction**: Utilize approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search techniques to reduce retrieval time and optimize GPU usage during the generation step.
- **Batch Processing**: Use batch processing for retrieval tasks to improve efficiency when handling high-volume queries.

*Example for caching with Redis:*
```python
import redis

# Connect to Redis
cache = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Check if the query response is in the cache
query = "What is the refund policy?"
cached_response = cache.get(query)
if cached_response:
    print("Cache Hit:", cached_response.decode('utf-8'))
else:
    # Assume response is generated here
    response = "Refunds are available within 30 days."
    cache.set(query, response)
```

### 6. Evaluation and Metrics
- **Retrieval Metrics**: Use **Precision@K**, **Recall@K**, and **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)** to evaluate the effectiveness of document retrieval.
- **Generation Quality Metrics**: Evaluate the generative model using metrics like **BLEU**, **ROUGE**, and human feedback to determine quality.
- **Scalability Metrics**: Measure the system's scalability by testing **Queries Per Second (QPS)** and monitoring resource usage under load.
- **Latency Metrics**: Measure end-to-end latency to ensure the system meets the response time requirements for interactive applications.

## Challenges to Expect
1. **Scalability Bottlenecks**: Efficiently scaling both retrieval and generation components is challenging, especially under high concurrency. Proper indexing, batching, and load balancing strategies must be in place.
2. **Factual Consistency**: Ensuring that the generated answers are factually accurate requires balancing retrieval relevance and controlling the generative model's creativity.
3. **Handling Ambiguity**: User questions can be vague. Designing effective query understanding and refinement mechanisms is essential for disambiguating user intent.
4. **Latency Control**: Achieving sub-second latency requires optimizing each component, from retrieval to response generation, and reducing dependency bottlenecks.

## Deliverables
- **A fully functional FAQ chatbot** capable of interacting with users, retrieving relevant documents, and generating accurate, context-rich answers.
- **Source code and documentation** for retrieval, generation, and integration components.
- **Deployment guide** using Docker and Kubernetes for scalability.
- **Evaluation report** detailing the performance metrics, latency, scalability, and areas for improvement.
