# 🛠️ Getting Started with RAG: A Beginner-Friendly Guide

In this guide, we’ll walk you through setting up a simple **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline from scratch. By the end, you’ll have a working system in **Google Colab** that retrieves relevant information from your documents and generates answers based on it. No complicated jargon—just step-by-step instructions to help you get started.

We’ll be using **FAISS** for document retrieval and **Hugging Face Transformers** for the generative part. By following along, you’ll learn how retrieval and generation come together to create responses that are both factually grounded and engaging.

Here’s what we’ll cover:

- **Setting Up Your Environment**: Installing the tools you need.
- **Uploading and Indexing Documents**: Preparing your data for retrieval.
- **Building the RAG Pipeline**: Tying retrieval and generation together.
- **Testing Your System**: Asking queries and getting responses.

Let’s jump in!

## 1. 🚀 Setting Up Your Environment

First things first—install the libraries that make everything work. Run this code in a Google Colab cell to install **FAISS**, **Transformers**, and **Sentence Transformers**:

```python
# Install dependencies
!pip install faiss-cpu transformers sentence-transformers
```

Once it’s done, you’re all set with the tools you’ll need. **FAISS** helps with finding similar documents, while **Transformers** handles the AI magic for both retrieval and response generation.

## 2. 📄 Uploading and Indexing Documents

Now let’s upload some documents for your system to use. We’ll create embeddings (representations of your documents) using **Sentence Transformers** and index them with **FAISS** for easy searching.

```python
import faiss
import numpy as np
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from google.colab import files

# Load a model to create embeddings
embedding_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Upload your documents
uploaded_files = files.upload()

# Read and store the content of each document
documents = []
for filename in uploaded_files.keys():
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        documents.append(file.read())

# Create embeddings for the documents
document_embeddings = embedding_model.encode(documents)

# Set up a FAISS index
embedding_dimension = document_embeddings.shape[1]
faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_dimension)
faiss_index.add(np.array(document_embeddings))

print(f"Successfully indexed {len(documents)} documents!")
```

### What’s happening here?

- **Upload**: You upload your text files (e.g., articles, FAQs, notes).
- **Embeddings**: Each document is turned into a numeric representation that captures its meaning.
- **Indexing**: **FAISS** organizes these embeddings so you can quickly find the most relevant ones later.

## 3. 🔄 Building the RAG Pipeline

Here’s where it all comes together. We’ll use a generative model, like **GPT-2**, to generate responses based on the documents retrieved by **FAISS**.

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
import torch

# Load GPT-2 for generation
generator_tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('distilgpt2')
generator_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('distilgpt2')

# Define a function to retrieve documents and generate answers
def generate_response(query, top_k=3):
    # Step 1: Get the query's embedding
    query_embedding = embedding_model.encode([query])
    
    # Step 2: Find the top-k relevant documents
    _, retrieved_indices = faiss_index.search(query_embedding, top_k)
    retrieved_docs = [documents[i] for i in retrieved_indices[0]]
    
    # Step 3: Prepare the input for GPT-2
    context = "\n".join(retrieved_docs) + "\nQuery: " + query + "\nAnswer:"
    input_ids = generator_tokenizer.encode(context, return_tensors='pt')
    
    # Step 4: Generate a response
    with torch.no_grad():
        output_ids = generator_model.generate(input_ids, max_length=200, num_return_sequences=1)
    
    # Decode and return the response
    response = generator_tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response

# Test it with an example query
query = "What are the benefits of using RAG?"
response = generate_response(query)
print("Generated Response:\n", response)
```

### Here’s what’s happening:

- **Retrieve**: The system searches the index for the most relevant documents using **FAISS**.
- **Combine**: The retrieved documents and the query are used as input for **GPT-2**.
- **Generate**: **GPT-2** produces a response enriched by the context of the retrieved documents.

## 4. 🧪 Testing Your System

Time to see it in action! Run a few queries and check out the responses.

```python
# Test your RAG system with sample queries
queries = [
    "How can I improve my internet connection?",
    "What is retrieval-augmented generation?",
    "Explain the benefits of using transformers in NLP."
]

for query in queries:
    response = generate_response(query)
    print(f"\nQuery: {query}\nResponse: {response}\n")
```

## 🎉 Wrapping Up

And there you have it—a basic RAG pipeline up and running! You’ve built a system that retrieves relevant information from documents and uses it to generate context-aware answers.

### Here are a few ideas to take it further:

- **Experiment with different retrieval models**, like **BM25** or **DPR**.
- **Try out more advanced generative models**, like **GPT-3** (via API).
- **Fine-tune your models** with domain-specific data for even better results.

With this foundation, you’re ready to explore the world of RAG and its many possibilities. Happy building! 🚀
