### 4. **Code Contributions** 🖥️
If you're interested in adding or improving code (tutorials, automation scripts, example projects), please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork locally and create a new branch for your changes.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LLMetaLab.git
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
3. Make your changes and commit them. Ensure your code follows best practices and includes adequate documentation.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add your clear commit message here"
   ```
4. Push the branch to your fork and **open a pull request**. Make sure you describe what you've done clearly.
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

## 🛠️ **Setting Up Your Environment**
To contribute effectively, follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/astorfi/LLMetaLab.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Python, Docker, and Git installed. You can install project dependencies by running:

## ✅ **Contribution Requirements**

### 1. **Use Docker for All Contributions** 🐳
Every contribution must include a `Dockerfile` to ensure an isolated and reproducible environment:
- **Add a Dockerfile** that includes all the necessary dependencies and configurations to run your code.
- This allows us to ensure that your contribution works independently of other projects in the repository.

### 2. **Provide Dependencies in `requirements.txt`** 📦
- Each contribution must include a `requirements.txt` file that lists the exact dependencies your code needs.
- This ensures that we can run your project with the correct library versions.

### 3. **Include Tests for Your Code** 🧪
- All contributions must include a **test file** (e.g., `test_project.py`) that tests the core functionality.
- We use **pytest** for testing, and it should run successfully inside your Docker container.

### 4. **Ensure CI/CD Compatibility** ⚙️
- All contributions must pass our automated CI/CD pipeline, which will:
  - **Build** your Docker container.
  - **Run** the tests you provided inside the Docker container.
- Only contributions that pass all checks will be merged.

## 🔄 **How to Submit Changes**
1. **Pull Request Guidelines**:
   - Provide a **clear and descriptive title** for your pull request.
   - Include a brief **summary** of what your pull request changes or adds.
   - **Link to the related issue**, if applicable.
   - Describe the **motivation and context** for your changes.

2. **Check the Checklist** before submitting a pull request:
   - Have you provided meaningful commit messages?
   - Have you checked for typos, grammar issues, and code formatting?
   - Have you linked any related issues?

## ✅ **Contribution Guidelines**
